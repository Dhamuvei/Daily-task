1.	How to compare two JSON have the same properties without order?
a.	var obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age:5 };
b.	var obj2 = { age:5, name: "Person 1" };

Solution :-   

1)	JSON.Stringify (same Order) 

•	It’s only applicable for same properties with same odder.
•	By using JSON.Stringify method we can convert array and object in to string.
•	Then we can compare those string with the assignment operation (=).

2)	Object. Entries(Different order)

•	It’s applicable for same properties with or without order.
•	By using Object.entries method we can call entire keys and value in object.
•	And convert the output in to string.
•	Then we can compare those string with the assignment operation (=).

Coding :-

var obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age:5 };
var obj2 = { age:5, name: "Person 1" };

let result = Object.entries(obj1).toString === Object.entries(obj2).toString;
console.log(result);

output : true
